# Taks

## MV prototype

These tasks are necessary before the test with the market, they are born mainly
by my interactions and testing the with some developers from USPCodeLab.

* [x] Hide the application code from the user, at least move the code away from
	the developer
* [ ] Add script to migrate from monolith to microservices
* [ ] Add a README.md to explain the project and its use
* [ ] Add a TEST.md explaining the task to test the prototype

## MV product

This section has tasks that are nice to have when lauching this project on NPM.
These tasks are not yet detailed, because I haven't planned them throughly.

* [ ] Build a simple CLI
* [ ] Make deploy easy

## Current feedback

* It is confusing in what parts should I add new code and what parts not to.
